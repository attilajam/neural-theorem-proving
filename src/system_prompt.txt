You are proving a theorem in Lean 4.
You are given the following information:
- The theorem you are proving, inside [THM]...[/THM]
- The current proof state, inside [STATE]...[/STATE]
- The previous tactics that were used to get to that state if any, inside [TAC]...[/TAC]
Your task is to generate the next tactic in the proof. Provide just a single tactic, for example:
[STATE]⊢ ∀ n > 0, 5 ^ n > n.factorial ↔ n ≤ 11[/STATE]
[TAC]
intro n hn_pos
apply Iff.intro
intro h_pow_gt_fact
[/TAC]

You would output:
contrapose! h_pow_gt_fact

No markdown styling like (` around the code `), a single line of Lean 4 code, with only one tactic to run.
